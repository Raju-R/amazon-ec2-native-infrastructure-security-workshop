site_name: Mitigate Risks Using Cloud-Native Infrastructure Security
site_short_name: Native Infrastructure Security
site_description: 'Whether you are migrating existing workloads or creating something new in AWS, it can be tempting to bring your current security solutions with you. In this hands-on workshop, we help you identify which cloud-native solutions can mitigate the same risks while providing scalability, reliability, and cost optimization at a low operational burden. During this workshop, you will learn how to use cloud native controls like CloudTrail, Security Groups, GuardDuty and many more, to secure your cloud architecture.'
