# Mitigate Risks Using Cloud-Native Infrastructure Security

In this workshop, you will learn how to use cloud native controls like CloudTrail, Security Groups, GuardDuty and many more, to secure your cloud architecture.

First you'll want to [Set up](./setup.md) your environment for this lab by running CloudFormation.

Then you will perform multiple steps that will guide you through different security tasks: 

1.    [Enable granular logging](./labsteps.md/#enable-granular-logging-to-see-everything-in-your-aws-environment)
2.    [Improve granular control of communication](#granular-provable-control-of-communications)
3.    [Improve granular network-based controls](#when-security-includes-explicitly-denying-network-access)
4.    [Evaluate detailed logging capabilities](#logging-actions-in-your-environment-and-making-it-easy-to-see-whats-changed)
5.    [Evaluate network-based protections](#logging-and-monitoring-of-the-network-for-bad-behavior-is-important-too)
6.    [Minimize admin access risk](#reducing-the-risk-of-admin-access-and-administrative-ports)

If you complete all six steps with time to spare, there is [Extra Credit](./extracredit.md) available.

Finally, make sure to [Clean up](./cleanup.md) your environment to ensure you don't have any continuing charges.

Many of the steps in this lab are written in general steps. This is intentional - we want you to learn the AWS interface, so we will not always specify each necessary click to accomplish a task.  We've written more of a guide than a tutorial. Please donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions.
