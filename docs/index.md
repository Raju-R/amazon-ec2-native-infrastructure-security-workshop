# Overview

Mitigate Risks Using Cloud-Native Infrastructure Security

Whether you are migrating existing workloads or creating something new in AWS, it can be tempting to bring your current security solutions with you. In this hands-on workshop, we help you identify which cloud-native solutions can mitigate the same risks while providing scalability, reliability, and cost optimization at a low operational burden. During this workshop, you will learn how to use cloud native controls like CloudTrail, Security Groups, GuardDuty and many more, to secure your cloud architecture.

## Scenario 
For this workshop, you will be securing an architecture that was a "refactored" migration from a traditional three tier on premise architecture. 

The network has two internet facing VPCs - one VPC for the Web Application and one sandbox for the developers called the Proof of Concept VPC. Additionally, there is a Services VPC that allows administrators to manage the network.

First you'll want to [Set up](./setup.md) your environment for this lab by running CloudFormation.

Then you will perform multiple steps that will guide you through different security tasks: 

1.    [Enable granular logging](./labsteps.md#enable-granular-logging-to-see-everything-in-your-aws-environment)
2.    [Improve granular control of communication](./labsteps.md#granular-provable-control-of-communications)
3.    [Improve granular network-based controls](./labsteps.md#when-security-includes-explicitly-denying-network-access)
4.    [Evaluate detailed logging capabilities](./labsteps.md#logging-actions-in-your-environment-and-making-it-easy-to-see-whats-changed)
5.    [Evaluate network-based protections](./labsteps.md#logging-and-monitoring-of-the-network-for-bad-behavior-is-important-too)
6.    [Minimize admin access risk](./labsteps.md#reducing-the-risk-of-admin-access-and-administrative-ports)

If you complete all six steps with time to spare, there is [Extra Credit](./extracredit.md) available.

Finally, make sure to [Clean up](./cleanup.md) your environment to ensure you don't have any continuing charges.

Many of the steps in this lab are written in general steps. This is intentional - we want you to learn the AWS interface, so we will not always specify each necessary click to accomplish a task.  We've written more of a guide than a tutorial. Please donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions.
